## Purpose and Vision

July Revolution Rendition: Echoes of Freedom aims to preserve and bring historical events to life through digital storytelling, ensuring that significant moments of resistance and collective action remain accessible and engaging for future generations.

The project seeks to educate audiences about the student uprising in Bangladesh against discriminatory government job quotas, using animation as a powerful medium to depict the courage and unity of students. By leveraging OpenGL and C++, it aims to create a compelling visual representation of history, bridging the gap between historical documentation and artistic storytelling.
